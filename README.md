# Audio-Amplifier-
This repository contains the  documentation for a BJT-based audio amplifier system that I developed from scratch. The amplifier system includes a differential amplifier, gain stage, filter stage, and power amplifier stage.
## Features:
- Implemented a comprehensive audio amplifier system using BJT transistors.
- Integrated differential amplifier, gain stage, filter stage, and power amplifier stage.
- Ensured optimal performance and reliability through rigorous testing and documentation.
